# Composable VLMs

Our current use case:
- Optimize the following processes in isolation before bringing them together in a menaingful application
  - sight tools:  optimize the validation of detection / segmentation / labeling / classification of images and video using an individual tool
  - true perception:  bringing the input of the various tools together in a meaningful way to improve what the solution and users can perceive
- VLMs are not the only tool in our Computer Vision toolbox, using VLMs to augment the quality of the overall solution is what is important here

Some analogies to help with the bigger picture:

- a simple analogy
  - from a human perspecitve stopping to consider the basic senses (signt, sound, touch, taste, smell) does help to expand our thinking to consider the importance of corrlating events that occur at the same time across modalities.
  - as humans we'll smell and taste that milk has gone bad before it looks rotten
- a better analogy of true perception and harmonization of various senses... training a humanoid robot to win the balance beam event at the Olympics
  - and giving the robot prehensile opposable toes is cheating
